# FowlerRefactoring2ndEd
C# language starting point example from Chapter 1 of Refactoring (2nd ed.), Martin Fowler et al.

The example Invoice function is presented in the same structure as in the book. The dynamic aspects of the C# language were used to emulate the dynamic nature of the original javascript example.

A single test has been provided (that passes).

Let the refactoring begin!
