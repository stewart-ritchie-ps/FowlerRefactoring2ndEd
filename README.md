# FowlerRefactoring2ndEd
This NET Core example (in C#) is intended to be a learning aid to be used with Chapter 1 of Refactoring (2nd ed.), Martin Fowler et al.

The example Invoice function is presented in the same structure as in Chapter 1 and a single test has been provided (that passes).

Let the refactoring begin!
